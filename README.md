# Drum Kit 

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is a keyboard key activated drum set. Each key corresponds to the letter on the keyboard and when pressed it makes a sound. 

Whilst building this app I learned the following:

~ How to use keyboard key codes. 
~ How to add and remove classLists.
~ Improves CSS skills.
